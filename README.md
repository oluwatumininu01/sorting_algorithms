0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Description
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

Data Structure and Functions
For this project you are given the following print_array, and print_list functions:

Project Tasks and Requirements
This project consists of multiple tasks, each of which requires you to implement a specific sorting algorithm or analyze the time complexity of an algorithm. Please refer to the project instructions and task-specific requirements for more details.

Task 0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.

Task 1. Insertion sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm.
